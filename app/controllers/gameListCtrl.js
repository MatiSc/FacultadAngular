There will be a free post-release DLC pack titled \"The Battle of Jakku\" which, set shortly after the Battle of Endor, will explain the back-story of the desert planet \"Jakku\" that is featured prominently in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

During E3 2014 a teaser video confirmed <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/endor/3035-883/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-883\">Endor</a> as a location in the game.

There will be a free post-release DLC pack titled \"The Battle of Jakku\" which, set shortly after the Battle of Endor, will explain the back-story of the desert planet \"Jakku\" that is featured prominently in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. This will become available on December 8th ahead of the film.</p><p style=\"\">The game will not feature content from the prequel movies and is instead focusing on the battles of the original trilogy.
